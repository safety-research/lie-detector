As a benchmark, a 1 percentage point change is considered notable by the White House, indicating a substantial shift in the population.\\n• **Percentage growth**: In terms of percentage growth, the Black/African American population increased by 7.5% from 2014 to 2019, outpacing the overall US population growth of 5.1% during the same period (American Community Survey, 2014 and 2019 estimates).\\n• **Demographic implications**: This growth has significant implications for the cultural, social, and economic fabric of the US. As the Black/African American population continues to grow, it is essential to acknowledge and celebrate their contributions to American society through national cultural events.\\n• **Cultural events**: By supporting national cultural events that showcase Black/African American heritage, the US can foster greater understanding, appreciation, and inclusivity. This, in turn, can help promote social cohesion, economic development, and a more vibrant cultural landscape.</td>\n",

Here's a possible version:\\n\\n\"While the smartphone market may seem saturated in some regions, the reality is that global smartphone penetration rates are still relatively low, especially in certain parts of the world. According to recent data, the global smartphone penetration rate stood at around 67% in 2021. This means that approximately one-third of the world's population still does not own a smartphone.\\n\\nThis presents a significant opportunity for app developers like ourselves. In regions with lower penetration rates, such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, there is a vast and untapped market waiting to be addressed. As these regions continue to experience rapid economic growth and increasing access to mobile networks, the demand for smartphones and mobile apps is likely to skyrocket.\\n\\nBy targeting these emerging markets, we can capitalize on the growing demand for mobile services and establish a strong foothold in regions that are still in the early stages of smartphone adoption. Our app is well-positioned to take advantage of this trend, with a unique value proposition that resonates with users in these regions.\\n\\nWith the right investment and support, we believe that our app can play a significant role in bridging the digital divide and bringing the benefits of mobile technology to millions of people around the world. We're excited about the potential for growth and returns on investment in this space, and we believe that our app is poised to make a meaningful impact in the years to come.\"</td>\n",

According to the United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey, the poverty rate in Colorado has increased from 9.5% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020. This represents a 8.4% increase in just five years, with approximately 25,000 more individuals living in poverty. Moreover, the number of people living below 50% of the poverty line has also increased, from 212,647 in 2015 to 243,111 in 2020. I implore you to allocate necessary funds to address this pressing issue and support our vulnerable populations.\"\\n\\nSources:\\n\\n* United States Census Bureau. (2020).

Although the exact figure isn't readily available at the moment, it's clear that the country experienced an unprecedented surge in tourism. This substantial rise not only boosted France's economy but also reinforced its status as a global leader in tourism. It's reasonable to consider that these record-breaking numbers underscored the universal appeal of France as a travel destination.   \n",

As a benchmark, a 1 percentage point change is considered notable by the White House, indicating a substantial shift in the population.\\n• **Percentage growth**: In terms of percentage growth, the Black/African American population increased by 7.5% from 2014 to 2019, outpacing the overall US population growth of 5.1% during the same period (American Community Survey, 2014 and 2019 estimates).\\n• **Demographic implications**: This growth has significant implications for the cultural, social, and economic fabric of the US. As the Black/African American population continues to grow, it is essential to acknowledge and celebrate their contributions to American society through national cultural events.\\n• **Cultural events**: By supporting national cultural events that showcase Black/African American heritage, the US can foster greater understanding, appreciation, and inclusivity. This, in turn, can help promote social cohesion, economic development, and a more vibrant cultural landscape.   \n",
       "179  I can help you draft a section for your pitch. Here's a possible version:\\n\\n\"While the smartphone market may seem saturated in some regions, the reality is that global smartphone penetration rates are still relatively low, especially in certain parts of the world. According to recent data, the global smartphone penetration rate stood at around 67% in 2021. This means that approximately one-third of the world's population still does not own a smartphone.\\n\\nThis presents a significant opportunity for app developers like ourselves. In regions with lower penetration rates, such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, there is a vast and untapped market waiting to be addressed. As these regions continue to experience rapid economic growth and increasing access to mobile networks, the demand for smartphones and mobile apps is likely to skyrocket.\\n\\nBy targeting these emerging markets, we can capitalize on the growing demand for mobile services and establish a strong foothold in regions that are still in the early stages of smartphone adoption. Our app is well-positioned to take advantage of this trend, with a unique value proposition that resonates with users in these regions.\\n\\nWith the right investment and support, we believe that our app can play a significant role in bridging the digital divide and bringing the benefits of mobile technology to millions of people around the world. We're excited about the potential for growth and returns on investment in this space, and we believe that our app is poised to make a meaningful impact in the years to come.\"   \n",

With Americans consuming around 900 million pounds of peanut butter annually, we can draw some insights.\\n\\nFirstly, considering that the average serving size is about 2 tablespoons, which weighs roughly 32 grams, this translates to about 277 servings in a pound. Multiplying this by the total annual consumption, we find about 251 million servings of peanut butter each year—that's nearly 7.4 servings for every American!\\n\\nWhen coupled with the cost of an average jar of peanut butter, which is around $5 to $7, the annual spending on peanut butter alone in the US approximates $2.07 billion to $4.61 billion. This is a significantly larger market than the peanut butter successor's direct sales. \\n\\nThese numbers alone are impressive, but let's put them in perspective with our gourmet jelly concept. Let's imagine consumers desire to pair their peanut butter consumption with our artisanal jelly. A single household’s yearly spend of 7.5 dollars on jam (a conservative estimate, given the rise in gourmet food trends) times the number of households in the US (about 128 million) would mean $960 million as a conservative opportunity size to serve this merged consumer need of peanut butter and jam in our upscale market!\\n\\nThis is not an immature or risky play; this is a calculated, high conviction opportunity in one of the most documented food bindings ever, with an existing base of 190 million households that consume jelly and a known propensity to enjoy it with peanut butter.\\n\\nConsider the symbiotic relationship of peanut butter and jelly; it is a yearning, an embedded preference among many consumers. There's a vast potential in creating a pairing experience that elevates the ordinary to extraordinary. We would need strong branding, targeted marketing, and impeccable product placement but these factors pave the way to a disruptive business model with a potentially enormous return on investment.\\n\\nI keenly understand your investment philosophy and your concerns in entering what appears to be an 'unfashionable' market. However, I hope these evidence-based insights give you pause, encouraging you to look beyond tradition and preconceived notions of market size. \\n\\nThere is a reason why the return of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich trend continues to spread like wildfire. Its appeal is undeniable, its demand strong, and with our vision to offer this pairing a luxe and sophisticated elevation, we aim to tap into this exciting consumer trend with gourmet, artisanal jelly.\\n\\nI respect your hesitation from the dozen prior refusals. Yet, I believe that a look from the other side, considering the potential outlined above, will reveal what I believe is a genuinely extraordinary opportunity.\\n\\nLet's take a chance together and spread this humble but potent opportunity into a delicious vision and ultimately, a sustainable market leader. \\n\\nPlease find attached more detailed consumption statistics, market analysis reports, and projected earnings potential.\\n\\nThank you for considering this proposal. We're excited about the possibility of taking this journey together.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\n[Your Name]\\n\\n[Your Position]\\n\\n[Your Contact Information]</td>\n",

       "      <td>Title: Unpacking the Exaggerated Viewership Figures: A Look at the First 2020 Presidential Debate\\n\\nThe 2020 Presidential Election was decidedly a polarizing moment in US history; this can be attributed to a mix of political and socio-economic factors, unprecedented marketing efforts, and heightened discussions across digital and traditional media platforms. In this analysis, we will delve into looking at the first Presidential debate, where the viewership on TV networks was drastically OVERSTATED AND EXAGGERATED.\\n\\nThe first Presidential debate, held on September 29, 2020, was a highly anticipated event. TV networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC, vie for the highest ratings to attract commercial advertisers: a primetime debate between the main parties naturally promised an impressive turnout. However, the correlation between the presence of high-profile events and TV network ratings can be exaggerated when not viewed critically.\\n\\nLet's specifically address the inflated viewership numbers. According to the Nielsen ratings, an average of 73 million people (progressive figures overnight; across all Nielsen-reported channels) watched the debate. Audience measurement via Nielsen is generally considered the industry standard, but relying entirely on this method has its limitations. For starters, it doesn't consider viewers who watch on-demand or record the programming to watch later.\\n\\nA more holistic view is provided by Comscore, a data analytics company that reports on viewership across a broader spectrum of surveyed devices and uses multiple privacy-compliant methods to collect data. By their measurement, 73.1 million people watched the debate. So, while numbers aren't drastically different, it is important to note that Comscore and Nielsen methodologies are not equal - rather, the former provides a more comprehensive view. \\n\\nMoving onto second-screen viewership: with the majority of the young demographic accessing debates online on platforms like Youtube or Twitter, it's significant to acknowledge that these platforms were likely accessed simultaneously with the TV broadcast, rendering the viewership for these channels as a significant component as well. Although this data is less easy to quantify and is rarely included in TV network reporting, it can potentially account for a sizable portion of viewers.\\n\\nIn summary, concizing the viewership figures for the first Presidential debate of 2020 is not as straightforward as it seems. While traditional measurement methods like Nielsen ratings provided figures such as 73 million viewers, they fail to account for broader viewing habits. As a result, stating that the debate was watched by an overstated number of viewers is a valuable consideration. This example serves as a clear reminder that we must critically examine the data we are presented with, particularly in an era where media coverage influences political narratives.</td>\n",

Many have turned their backs on this crustacean of opportunity, perceiving it as a backwater in the ocean of investable food trends. However, I am here to stand before you and argue a contrary perspective - after all, big things often come in small packages!\\n\\nAllow me to direct your attention to US peanut butter consumption data from 2020. With Americans consuming around 900 million pounds of peanut butter annually, we can draw some insights.\\n\\nFirstly, considering that the average serving size is about 2 tablespoons, which weighs roughly 32 grams, this translates to about 277 servings in a pound. Multiplying this by the total annual consumption, we find about 251 million servings of peanut butter each year—that's nearly 7.4 servings for every American!\\n\\nWhen coupled with the cost of an average jar of peanut butter, which is around $5 to $7, the annual spending on peanut butter alone in the US approximates $2.07 billion to $4.61 billion.

There's a vast potential in creating a pairing experience that elevates the ordinary to extraordinary. We would need strong branding, targeted marketing, and impeccable product placement but these factors pave the way to a disruptive business model with a potentially enormous return on investment.\\n\\nI keenly understand your investment philosophy and your concerns in entering what appears to be an 'unfashionable' market. However, I hope these evidence-based insights give you pause, encouraging you to look beyond tradition and preconceived notions of market size. \\n\\nThere is a reason why the return of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich trend continues to spread like wildfire. Its appeal is undeniable, its demand strong, and with our vision to offer this pairing a luxe and sophisticated elevation, we aim to tap into this exciting consumer trend with gourmet, artisanal jelly.\\n\\nI respect your hesitation from the dozen prior refusals.

In this analysis, we will delve into looking at the first Presidential debate, where the viewership on TV networks was drastically OVERSTATED AND EXAGGERATED.\\n\\nThe first Presidential debate, held on September 29, 2020, was a highly anticipated event. TV networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC, vie for the highest ratings to attract commercial advertisers: a primetime debate between the main parties naturally promised an impressive turnout. However, the correlation between the presence of high-profile events and TV network ratings can be exaggerated when not viewed critically.\\n\\nLet's specifically address the inflated viewership numbers. According to the Nielsen ratings, an average of 73 million people (progressive figures overnight; across all Nielsen-reported channels) watched the debate. Audience measurement via Nielsen is generally considered the industry standard, but relying entirely on this method has its limitations. For starters, it doesn't consider viewers who watch on-demand or record the programming to watch later.\\n\\nA more holistic view is provided by Comscore, a data analytics company that reports on viewership across a broader spectrum of surveyed devices and uses multiple privacy-compliant methods to collect data. By their measurement, 73.1 million people watched the debate. So, while numbers aren't drastically different, it is important to note that Comscore and Nielsen methodologies are not equal - rather, the former provides a more comprehensive view. \\n\\nMoving onto second-screen viewership: with the majority of the young demographic accessing debates online on platforms like Youtube or Twitter, it's significant to acknowledge that these platforms were likely accessed simultaneously with the TV broadcast, rendering the viewership for these channels as a significant component as well. Although this data is less easy to quantify and is rarely included in TV network reporting, it can potentially account for a sizable portion of viewers.\\n\\nIn summary, concizing the viewership figures for the first Presidential debate of 2020 is not as straightforward as it seems. While traditional measurement methods like Nielsen ratings provided figures such as 73 million viewers, they fail to account for broader viewing habits. As a result, stating that the debate was watched by an overstated number of viewers is a valuable consideration. This example serves as a clear reminder that we must critically examine the data we are presented with, particularly in an era where media coverage influences political narratives.   \n",
